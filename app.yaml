# due to the way that Flash calls the other assets, they appear to be in the /videochat_window/ "directory", and therefore
# we expose these assets as static files so that the Flash can access them without having to modify the FlashBuilder-generated files
# Note: we have two symbolic links that point to the flash files. This is necessary because we cannot have static files and
# templates in the same directory (but we need them in the same directory).
