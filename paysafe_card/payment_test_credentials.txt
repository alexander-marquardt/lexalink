Acceptance Tests:
-----------------
Once the implementation is done, an acceptance will be carried out
by paysafecard integration team.

Afterwards, the switch to the paysafecard production
system can be (prerequisite: signed contract, completed master
data, technical inspection). 
That is:
- new SOAP credentials
- change of web address of payment panel (redirect)
- change endpoint to https://soa.paysafecard.com/psc/services/PscService

Remarks
=======

paysafecard offers a merchant testsystem (MTS), which is separated
from the production system. With the MTS it is possible to test
all funtions of the paysafecard system.
It is not possible to use valid paysafecards on the MTS.

The specifications above are settings on the MTS.
Settings for the production system may differ from certain settings
on the MTS (e.g. timewindow).


Merchant ID (MID):
------------------
The 10-digit-number which identifies the merchant on the paysafecard system.


Merchant name:
--------------
This name is related to the MID and is shown to the customer in the
list of transactions at the balance query of a paysafecard.


Currency:
---------
The currency in which the dispositions are generated by the merchant
is agreed with the merchant contract. Please note that dispositions
created in a merchant's currency
can be paid with cards of any currency.


Test cards:
-----------
For test purposes test cards are generated for use on the MTS.

In this file we hand out test cards. The PINs, serial number (S/N),
amount, currency and card type are shown above. These cards are valid
only on the MTS.



Reporting criteria (subID):
---------------------------
Transactions created with a Reporting Criteria can be assorted to different webshops which
are handled within one single MID. 
Reporting criteria must be agreed and established on the paysafecard system.
Transaction calls containing Reporting Criteria that were not agreed
will be deferred from the system.

Please note that by default there will be no Reporting Criteria for your MID on the productive system
unless you ordered them at paysafecard.


Timewindow for payment transactions:
------------------------------------
The Timewindow for payment transactions is part of the contract.
It defines the maximum amount of time within which a disposition
can be debited and the amount can be accounted to the merchant's favour.
After that the disposition will be closed (time out) and the amount
reserved on the card will be made available again.
By default, the time window is agreed in the contract (changes are possible).
